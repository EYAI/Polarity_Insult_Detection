# Polarity_Insult_Detection
The French Language Polarity and Insult Detection project aims to develop an intelligent system capable of automatically analyzing and classifying texts based on their tone (positive, negative, or neutral) and detecting and flagging insults or offensive language.
## Key Features

- **Models**: Utilizes pre-trained machine learning models for polarity analysis and insult detection, fine-tuned to handle nuances, slang, and regional variations in the French language.

- **Customization**: Offers the ability to re-train or fine-tune the models on specific datasets or domains, allowing for flexibility in usage.

- **Performance**: Optimized for real-time processing, ensuring efficient handling of large volumes of text data with minimal latency.

- **Ethical Considerations**: Designed with fairness in mind, the tool aims to provide unbiased detection while avoiding censorship of legitimate expressions of opinion.
